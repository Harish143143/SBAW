        <p> They are often used as a source of energy. Here are some common uses:</p>
        <ol>
        <li>Biomass Fuel:</li>
        <p>Rice husks can be burned as a biomass fuel to generate heat and energy. They can be used for cooking, heating, and even powering small generators.
            Construction Materials: Rice husks can be mixed with other materials to create building materials like boards, panels, and bricks.
            Animal Bedding: In some cases, rice husks can be used as bedding material for animals due to their absorbent properties.</p>
        <li>Rice Bran:</li>
        <p >Rice bran is a byproduct of the milling process and is rich in nutrients and oils. It has several potential uses:
            <ul>
                <li>Animal Feed</li>
                <p>Rice bran can be used as a nutritious component in animal feed, especially for livestock and poultry.</p>
                <li>Oil Extraction:</li>
                <p>The oil extracted from rice bran is used in cooking, as well as in the production of cosmetics, soap, and other products.</p>
                <li>Fertilizer:</li>
                <p>Rice bran can be composted and used as a soil conditioner and fertilizer due to its nutrient content</p>
            
            </ul>
        </p>
         <li>Mulching:</li>
         <p>Rice husks can be used as a mulching material to cover the soil in gardens or agricultural fields. This helps retain moisture, suppress weed growth, and regulate soil temperature.</p>
          <li>Building Materials:</li>
           <p>Rice husks can be used in the production of sustainable building materials like particle boards, fiberboards, and insulation panels.</p>
          <li>Crafts and Art:</li>
           <p>Rice husks can be creatively used in crafting, such as making decorative items, baskets, or even paper products.</p>
          <li>Horticulture and Gardening:</li>
           <p>Rice husks can be mixed into potting mixes or garden soil to improve drainage and aeration for plants in pots or garden beds.</p>

    
        </ol>
     <li style="font-size:18px;"><strong>Plastic:</strong></li>  
     <p>Plastic is a versatile and widely used material that has revolutionized various industries and aspects of modern life due to its unique properties.
